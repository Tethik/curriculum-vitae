\section{Summary}
I am a newly graduated Master in Computer Science who studied at KTH in Stockholm, Sweden. My focus was on computer security. Since the age of 17, I've also worked part time as a professional programmer. I've worked a lot with web development, but also with scraping and some mobile app development. The past few years I've also focused on security. I've performed some minor penetration tests, as well as contributed by finding and disclosing vulnerabilities to companies. 

I am confident in my ability as a software engineer, backed by a combination of theoretical and practical experience from having studied and worked at the same time. My keen interest in the subject will ensure that I always keep learning.

 &\footnotesize{I perform penetration testing focused on Network-, Application-, and Web Security, as well as take on more specialized programming projects. I reverse engineered an Android application and assessed store-networks for vulnerabilities for a major coffee-shop company (100+ stores). I built multiple web-scrapers with infrastructure for a major Scandinavian retail chain to gather information about competitors' products and prices.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
 
 \textsc{May-Oct 2015} & Part-time Security Consultant and Programmer at \textsc{Bambora}\\
 &\emph{Mobile Payment Company}\\&\footnotesize{Short term hire after finding vulnerabilities in the mobile payment platform delivered by Bambora. Performed penetration tests and prototyped new features to improve security at the mobile division of Bambora. Added encryption for locally stored user credentials to better secure the user data stored on a phone against e.g. theft. Prototyped platform-authentication for clients using BankID. Focused on web and mobile security. Android and Python development.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\

\section{Project Showcase}
These are some open source projects I've worked on. A more complete project list can be supplied upon request. I also have more projects on my github account, which you can find here: \href{https://github.com/Tethik}{https://github.com/Tethik}\\

\subsection{Burn After Reading}
A simple to use webservice for securely sending secrets. It works by encrypting texts in javascript, sending the key in such a way that the server should not see it. The server then stores the text in memory until either the recipient decides to "burn" the text or the time expires. I use it to send passwords and other secrets that I don't want to be kept saved in e.g. an email inbox or chat thread. Coded in javascript and python.

\subsection{Tamperfree}
A tool to verify static content on tor hidden service websites. It uses selenium to emulate the tor browser bundle in order to make a verifier that looks and acts just like a normal tor user would. By doing this I hope to achieve indistinguishability from a real user, so that the server can not differentiate between the verifier and real user. Mostly a proof of concept. Coded in python.

\subsection{PYPI Python Packages}
Throughout 2016-2017 I published some smaller python packages in the official python package index.

\begin{itemize}
\item Badger. A simple commandline program to generate SVG badges offline.\\ \href{https://pypi.python.org/pypi/badger}{https://pypi.python.org/pypi/badger}
\item Flask-Session-Captcha. A captcha generator for the Flask framework.\\ \href{https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flask-session-captcha}{https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flask-session-captcha}
\item simplegeoip. A simple wrapper library for getting geolocation from an ip.\\ \href{https://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplegeoip}{https://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplegeoip}
